# Economic Advantages of the Social Benefits of Open Source Software

Discuss how the social benefits of a company’s contributing to open
source software can present economic advantages.

Since Netscape released the source code of Netscape Communicator 4.0 in
1998, the technology industry has been engrossed in discussing the
relationship between for-profit companies and open source. It seems
there will be a never-ending discussion surrounding companies publishing
code for which they have no copyright. There is extensive research in
this field on the social and economic aspects of open source. Research
on the social aspects of open source tends to focus on the morality of
open source. There is not much research on how the social aspects of
open source cause economic advantages. It is economically advantageous
for a company to contribute to open source because it improves its
public image, its attractiveness to potential employees, employee
retention, and employee productivity.

James Pearce, Head of Open Source at Facebook[^1], stated in [a Facebook
meeting](https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/12/facebooks-head-of-open-source-gives-3-reasons-why-the-company-open-sources-its-technology/)
that Facebook has “an altruistic and ideological obligation to” open
source its projects because “Facebook was built on open source… So,
we’ve always had that moral obligation to give back.” His outlook—that
if a developer takes advantage of open source software, he or she should
reciprocate others’ generosity by contributing to open source—is shared
throughout[^2] the developer community. Without delving deeply into why
giving back to open source is moral, as has been done before, it can be
simplified with the following analogy: open-source is to software
development as “give-a-penny-take-a-penny” jars are to grocery shopping.
If an entity takes and never gives, it takes advantage of others’
generosity. If it gives and takes the same amount, it demonstrates basic
morality by not taking advantage of others’ generosity, even if taking
advantage of that generosity offers an economic gain. If it gives
notably more than it takes, it is more than moral, it is altruistic—a
benefactor of the common good. The more an entity gives, the more
morality and generosity it displays. Over 97 percent of companies “use
\[open source software\] in any way”[^3] and “on average, open source
code comprises 35 percent of a commercial application.”[^4] According to
[a 2010 survey by
Accenture](https://newsroom.accenture.com/subjects/research-surveys/investment-in-open-source-software-set-to-rise-accenture-survey-finds.htm),
only 29 percent of companies contribute to open source. Thus, 68 percent
of companies are amoral, perhaps immoral, “takers.” Because such a large
portion of companies abstain from giving back to open source, any
company who publishes at least one percent of its code as open source
joins the less than a third of companies which have put at least one
penny in the jar from which they have taken, on average, thirty-five.
And, because its penny is publicly available on the internet, everyone
knows that it has shared a penny. Contributing to open source software
presents companies with the opportunity to improve their public image
and social responsibility. The social benefits of contributing to open
source also cause economic advantages.

A company’s heightened social responsibility from contributing to open
source attracts and retains productive, talented employees because of
how a company’s contributing to open source indirectly appeals to
developers’ job priorities and because of Millennials’ value for
corporate social responsibility.

There is a great, and increasing, value for corporate social
responsibility in the current developer job market. According to a
Stanford Graduate School of Business study, “[Corporate Social
Responsibility Reputation Effects on MBA Job
Choice](http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2673&context=lkcsb_research),”
ninety percent[^5] of graduates from business schools in Europe and
North America “prefer working for organizations committed to social
responsibility.” This statistic is particularly important because it
surveys only Millennials, indicating that the value for corporate social
responsibility may grow as Millennials become adults. It also indicates
the value of corporate social responsibility among developers in the
current job market. According to Stack Overflow’s [2016 Developer Survey
Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-job-priorities),
77.2% of developers are 35 or younger[^6]. Extrapolating from the
Stanford study, 69.5% of developers “prefer working for organizations
committed to social responsibility.” Should a company seek to attract
developers, it is increasingly important that it display social
responsibility.

Contributing to open source helps companies fulfill the corporate social
responsibility that many young people look for when searching for
employment. Per the same study, given twenty-one options, 41.8% of
developers chose “Company Culture” as a priority and 35.9% of developers
chose “Build\[ing\] Something that’s Significant” as a priority when
looking for employment. Given the intrinsic altruistic effects of a
company’s contributing to open source software, including contributing
to collective wisdom by allowing external developers to learn from the
software’s code, promoting transparency[^7] between corporations and
consumers, and enabling free use of the software, it is logical that
generosity would permeate the company culture. Likewise, all open source
products are “significant” for, at minimum, the aforementioned positive
social effects of open source software.

A company’s neglecting to contribute to open source software can harm
its perception by developers, negatively affect its company culture, and
hinder the significance of its product. As discussed in the previous
section and elaborated upon in the footnotes, there is an overwhelming
belief among developers that companies which use open source software
have a moral obligation to contribute to open source. Unless a company
lies in the less than three percent[^8] of companies which abstain from
using open source software, if it does not contribute to open source, it
fails the developer-constructed moral obligation to reciprocate open
source developers’ generosity. This damages its social perception.
Accounting for the previous logic where contributing to open source made
for a more open and generous company culture, it follows that a company
which does not contribute to open source would have a less
socially-minded company culture than they would if they did contribute.
Following the logic where contributing to open source enhances products’
significance, it follows that failing to do so hinders the significance
of the product. Per the Stanford and Stack Overflow surveys, these
effects decrease the company’s appeal to potential employees. This
section discussed how contributing to open source attracts new
employees. Some effects of the heightened social responsibility more
directly assist employee retention.

There is an incredible value for employee retention among technology
companies primarily because of the tech industry’s high employee
turnover rates and the high costs of replacing employees. According to
Stack Overflow’s 2016 Developer Survey, 14.8% of respondents stated they
were “actively looking for a new job” and 63.1% stated they were “not
actively looking, but… open to new opportunities.” Note that 67.8% of
respondents were employed full-time, indicating a large amount of
employed developers are interested in leaving their current job. Many of
these developers do leave for new jobs. Per PayScale’s [recent employee
turnover
report](https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/employee-loyalty/least-loyal-employees),
the employee turnover rate among Fortune 500 companies in the technology
industry is the highest among all industries. Amazon and Google, both
well-known for the measures they take to retain employees, fall in the
top five for lowest median tenure, at one year and 1.1 years,
respectively. “[Retaining
Talent](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/special-reports-and-expert-views/Documents/Retaining-Talent.pdf),”
a 2008 study by the Society for Human Resource Management, predict that
the average cost for replacing a salaried employee is six to nine months
of salary. Thus, these companies lose considerable capital when
employees leave. To combat these high turnover rates, technology
companies go to extraordinary lengths to increase employee retention.
Their methods, surprisingly, do not lie in promising year-end bonuses
and other financial incentives, but in maintaining employee’s happiness.
In [an interview with
Bloomberg](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-laszlo-bock-how-to-retain-employees-2015-4),
Laszlo Bock, the Senior Vice President of Google’s People Operations
(Human Resources), stated that “People don’t stay for the money” and
noted that more than a third of Google’s first 100 employees have not
left despite coming into fortunes after Google’s IPO. He stated that the
reason people stay at Google is because “of the quality of the people
they work with” and “the feeling that the work they do is
meaningful.”[^9] Google’s People Operations’s bases its initiatives off
of the research of Google’s People Analytics branch, which “uses a
data-driven approach to inform your people practices, programs and
processes.” Because of this and People Operations’s focus on improving
employee happiness[^10], improving employee happiness increases employee
retention. Studies also show that improving employee happiness increases
productivity.

Contributing to open source increases employee productivity by creating
an attractive company culture and augments products’ significance.
Happiness has become of utmost importance across tech companies as new
studies show that happiness directly correlates to productivity. One
such study by University of Bozen-Bolzano titled “[Happy software
developers solve problems better: psychological measurements in
empirical software engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00922.pdf)”
establishes that “positive affective states of software developers are
indicators of higher analytical problem-solving skills” and “offer\[s\]
an initial support for the claim that an increase in productivity is
expected by making software developers happy.”

Because contributing to open source attracts developers (particularly
young developers), contributing to open source gives companies a more
enthusiastic applicant pool. An enthusiastic applicant translates,
logically, to a happy employee who will enthusiastically work at an open
source company. By contributing to open source, a company attracts
happy, enthusiastic workers. Per Google’s research, there is a direct
correlation between employee happiness and employee retention and
productivity. Increasing employee retention is economic because of the
high costs of replacing employees, as shown by the Society for Human
Resource’s study. Increasing productivity is self-explanatorily
economic. It is economically advantageous for a company to contribute to
open source because it improves its public image, its attractiveness to
potential employees, employee retention, and employee productivity. With
the increasing value for corporate social responsibility, it seems these
benefits will continue to increase in importance.

    closed-source competitors may not.
